# Ed/X Front End Web Dev Prestudy work

## Pre-work study guide

The pre-work study guide allows the course users to naviagte an easy place to get course information. It includes the creation of Github repositories as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

My main motivation for doing this project (for well over 25 hours now) was to prove to myself that coding is all about logic and sequence, not a measure of intelligence but rather perservernace and resillience. One that I am happy to say I believe I have succeeded. 

I built this project as it is the basic fundamentals to front end coding. HTML, CSS, JS are used frequently in coding therefore it was imperative for me to master the basics. 

The problems it solves is how to build on HTML as well as providing a web page for students to look at to remind themselves as to what the course covers. In addition to that, it shows what code is used to style content with CSS and how to make it interactive using JavaScript. 

I learnt many things in the duration of a short span of time, such as;

- how to list things in ordered and un ordered lists
- how to format pages with cards, dimensions, colour, etc.
- how to pull from Githubs repo's and then how to push them back  in branches so that the main isn't altered until the changes are merged from local to Github.
- how JavaScript interacts with with HTML to make it interactive, but that it follows a logical order (that can be amended if needs be)

## Usage

1. Create and download a GitHub account.
2. Install Git bash and VS Code.
3. Install necessary extentions in VS Code.
4. Create a respository on Github
5. Create an SSH key for Github by creating it in Gitbash and adding it to the repository on settings in Gitbash.
6. Be sure to connect your Gitbash (aka local) to Github.
7. Use Gitbash to open VS code using 'code .'
8. Edit/ add/ create/ save accordingly.
9. Be sure to sync local repo and Github repo.

## How to Contribute

I am happy to consider any contribution for future projects, but for this one.. Alas, it needs to be a solo effort.
